Before using any of the test codes copy paste the src folder(from https://github.com/sayZeeel/Biofeedback-game-controller) in the arduino library folder or import them using import library function ,present in the arduino ide
List of things needed for the project:
Flex Sensors(Quantity: 4) or EMG Muscle Sensors(Quantity:4).
Arduino Micro.(You can use a Due or Leonardo depending on your i/o requirement)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires.(You will also need a solder iron.)
Resistors( I used 47 K ohm but anything can be used.Quantity:4)
Gloves.
Basic Steps:
1. Capturing muscle movement data
2. Transmitting the data to computer
3. Programming the computer to use this data.
